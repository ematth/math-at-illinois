# Abstract Linear Algebra (MATH416)

## Official Course Description

Math 416 is a rigorous, abstract treatment of linear algebra. Topics to be
covered include vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues and
eigenvectors, diagonalizability, and inner product spaces. The course concludes
with a brief introduction to the theory of canonical forms for matrices and
linear transformations.

### Unofficial Description (Student Feedback)

This is a proof based introductory course on linear algebra. Prior experience
with proof-writing is highly recommended, but no prior linear algebra experience
is needed.
