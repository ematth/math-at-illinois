#  Introduction to Higher Mathematics (MATH314)

## Official Course Description

Skills and techniques necessary to identify valid mathematical proofs and to produce valid mathematical proofs. Students will also be exposed to beginning ideas in several advanced mathematical topics, including modular arithmetic, group theory, combinatorial reasoning, solving equations, epsilon-delta arguments, and limits. This course is particularly focused on students who have no prior proof-writing experience; students with prior proof-writing experience, or with less need for training in writing proofs, should consider [[math347|MATH347]] instead.

### Unofficial Description (Student Feedback)

A relatively new (ever since 2024) course on proof writing, as an attempt to standarize [[math347|MATH347]]. Math 314 covers less topics than Math 347, but is considered to go more in depth. For students with prior proof writing experience, it's recommended to try [[math347|MATH347]] or 314 **honors** section. 

## Official Prerequisites

[[math241|MATH241]]

#### Notes on Enrolling

## Degree Requirements Fulfilled

This course satisfies a core requirement or an elective requirement* for the following programs:

Mathematics, BS

Mathematics and Computer Science, BS

Mathematics Minor

## General Advice

There are 3 midterms and a final. Some amount of your grade will also depend on homework. Homework problems are usually directly related/continuations of lecture content and Office Hours is a great resource if you're stuck on the problems. Lecture attendance is not mandatory, however attendance is checked in recitation. Recitation worksheets also are good practice for the midterms/final.   

## General Postrequisites

This course is a prerequisite for most abstract 400 math courses. 

## Resources

Introduction to Higher Mathematics (Lee DeVille, Christopher Dodd, and Fulton Jackson)

## Honors

The honors section requires approval from the math department, which requires a grade of A- or higher in [[math241|MATH241]], or a score of 95% or higher on [[math241|MATH241]] proficency exam.
