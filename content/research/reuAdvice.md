# Advice for REUs

## What are REUs?
REUs are Research Experiences for Undergraduates that are funded by the
National Science Foundation. Their whole purpose is to get people their
first experience with research in their field of choice. These are funded
programs if you are a US citizen, typically meaning that you will be
reimbursed for housing, meals, and travel. If you are not a US citizen
then you may only be partially funded (or may have to pay for these out of
pocket). REUs are a great way to try out research for a shorter time span
and see if you do like it or not. Nowhere else as an undergrad will you
get to do research and research alone with no worries of exams and
homework. Also, these are a great way to get a letter of recommendation
for graduate school. These programs run over the summer, meaning you
cannot, and are explicitly not allowed to, do an internship alongside.
These are for first experiences in research, meaning they do not expect
prior research experience! So do not be shy when applying! Also if you are
reading this, you probably have some programming background. This is a
huge advantage for you! In the past, people have been selected for
projects because they knew how to program! Many REU projects are very
computational in nature, so take advantage of this.
Apply to many REUs! It really is not that much harder to apply to many REU
sites as it is to apply for a few, especially since there are no OAs or
interviews. These are really competitive programs, often more competitive
than even graduate school admissions (at least according to UChicago).

## Personal Statements

There are no OAs or interviews. The most important material you will
submit is your Personal Statement talking about why you want to do
research in your field of choice, why that particular program of choice is
a good fit for you, and how being a part of an REU will further your goals
(pursuing research, graduate school, whatever). Start drafting your
personal statement early and revise and revise. Have someone read it over,
preferably someone who has done an REU and even one or two of your letter
writers. These should be 1 page long.

### Example Personal Statements

Below are the personal statements of UIUC students who have gotten into
REUs before!

## Letters of Recommendation

You will need two letters of rec, preferably from professors in the field
you are working in. Ideally these professors will be able to say more than
"they did well in my class." I recommend asking for letters before finals
hit if you can, and ask in office hours rather than email. I'm not sure
how important that is but it feels nicer to me than an email. You should
ask for a strong letter of recommendation. It is rare, but not unheard of,
for people to agree to write a letter and then write a not-so-good letter.
There are right and wrong ways to do this but asking for a "strong letter
of recommendation" should be enough, as compared to just asking for a
letter of recommendation.

One thing you can do is that when they do say yes, reply to them with your
statement of purpose and resume. Say that they can use those in their
letter if they want but they don't have to. If you have a common theme of
the programs you are applying to (algebra, analysis, combo, etc) then you
can mention that you are focused on that area. They may not need that
information but it can be nice to have.

## Timeline

Most REUs have due dates in late Jan / early Feb. Plan accordingly for
this! Ask your letter writers before winter break starts. Get a few drafts
of your personal statement done over winter break. Writing sucks, so do it
while you aren't swamped with homework.
