#  Calculus III (MATH241)

## Official Course Description

Third course in calculus and analytic geometry including vector analysis: Euclidean space, partial differentiation, multiple integrals, line integrals and surface integrals, the integral theorems of vector calculus.

### Unofficial Description (Student Feedback)

Third series of the core calculus sequence. Very much graph/visual (since it's 3d) based unlike calculus I and II. 

## Official Prerequisites

[[math231|MATH231]] or 4/5 on the AP Calculus BC test

#### Notes on Enrolling

There are many professors/grad students that teach the course and change each semester, so choose appropriately.

## Degree Requirements Fulfilled

This course satisfies a core requirement or an elective requirement* for the following programs:

Mathematics, BS

Mathematics and Computer Science, BS

Mathematics Minor

Statistics, BS

Statistics and Computer Science, BS

Actuarial Science, BS

All Grainger Engineering Majors

## General Advice

There are 3 midterms and a final. There's also homeworks due every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (via an online ebook) and there are discussion section worksheets each week. It is also recommended to brush up on integrating trig functions. Lecture attendance is not mandatory. 

Note that extra credit (in non-honors sections) is extremely limited and the course is usually not curved.

## General Postrequisites

This course is a prerequisite for higher level math and stat courses, as well as a core course for many Engineering/LAS majors.
