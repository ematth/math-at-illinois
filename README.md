## Build/run/preview the project locally
Quartz requires at least [Node v22](https://nodejs.org/en) and npm v10.9.2 to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.

```
git clone https://github.com/3nya/math-at-illinois.git
cd math-at-illinois
```


If building for the first time:
```
npm i
npx quartz create
```

Run project locally - this should open quartz at `http://localhost:8080/`
```
npx quartz build --serve
```
`ctrl+s` to save changes, local changes should be shown pretty fast.
