# Graph Theory (MATH412)

## Official Course Description

Examines basic concepts and applications of graph theory, where graph refers to a set of vertices and edges that join some pairs of vertices; topics include subgraphs, connectivity, trees, cycles, vertex and edge coloring, planar graphs and their colorings. Draws applications from computer science, operations research, chemistry, the social sciences, and other branches of mathematics, but emphasis is placed on theoretical aspects of graphs.

### Unofficial Description (Student Feedback)

This is a proof-based introductory course on graph theory. Compared to the courses in the Group 3 requirement of the Math&CS degree, it is more difficult and proof-heavy than [[math314|MATH314]] but less abstract than [[math417|MATH417]]. Previous experience with proofs, through courses such as [[math314|MATH314]] and CS 374, is heavily recommended. The official textbook for the course is Graph Theory by Douglas B West. 

## Official Prerequisites 

[[math314|MATH314]] or CS 374

#### Notes on Enrolling

Enrollment is initially only open to Mathematics and Math&CS majors. 

## Degree Requirements Fulfilled

This course satisfies a core requirement or an elective requirement* for the following programs:

Mathematics and Computer Science, BS (Group III)

## General Advice

This class will be heavily proof-based but less abstract than some other pure math courses. Hence, one can expect a reasonable but not easy workload. Many students find the first few weeks of the course relatively easy, but there is a significant jump in course difficulty after the first midterm. Going to office hours and the study sessions will be very helpful for this course, and can also help one with entering ICLUE if they demonstrate interest and engagement with the course material.
